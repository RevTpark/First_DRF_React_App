# Blog App with Django X React.
## This blog app is my attempt at integrating [Django-REST](<https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>) with [React.js](<https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html>) using documentations.
This is a normal blog that supports Login, Registeration, Making a Post, Editing, Updating and Deleting. Again this is just more of a visual project and learning project so some things are incomplete.\
The authentication is done by Django-REST Framework and Authorization using JWT. Frontend uses Axios Instance to communicate with backend.
## Running Locally
The app is not deployed yet. After cloning, App can be run locally using these commands in order:
```
pip install requirements.txt
cat npm_requirements.txt | xargs npm install -g
npm start
py manage.py runserver
```
# Some Basic and Salient Features
# Home Page 
Home page contains every post that was published to the blog. The frontend was coded using Material-UI components and documentations.

## Login In
After making a new account Users can login in to their account. After loging in JWT kicks in and creates tokens for sessions of 5 minutes. Supported with refresh tokens.

## Post Control
Admin can control the posts made by everyone. Further I will try to authorize users to edit, update and delete their own posts.

## API Docs
Something new I learned with this project is API documentation wiht the help of schema. This is pure backend which helps other developers to understand the different end points.
